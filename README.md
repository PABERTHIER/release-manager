# .net-nuxt-template

## A template for .Net/Nuxt3 SPA application

This repo has been made to be used as a default template to create .Net/Nuxt3 SPA project.

## Setup to launch the SPA

Try to use the latest version of Node.js (using the 20.10.0 for Nuxt 3.9 for example).

If you need to switch from Node version, you can use NVM or FNM.
For NVM:

- [Github repo](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#readme)
- [Installation guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/)

You can easily list your versions installed with this cmd ```nvm list```.
Or see your current version ```nvm current```.
You can install a new version with ```nvm install your_version```.
To use the needed version, ```nvm use your_version```.

For FNM:

- [Github repo](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm)

Now that you're using the right Node version, you can use this template and make your own project.
